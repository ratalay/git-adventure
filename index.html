    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>
    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.</p>
    <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
    <p>We don't want to show our mistakes to people. So we create a new branch and work off it.</p>
    <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
    <p>Your working tree is what is actually in the files that you are currently working on. HEAD is a pointer to the branch or commit that you last checked out, and which will be the parent of a new commit if you make it</p>
    <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
    <p>The staging area is like a rough draft space, it's where you can git add the version of a file or multiple files that you want to save in your next commit (in other words in the next version of your project)</p>
    <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
    <p>git pull</p>
